# CleanCAst_backend

Final project repository for UC Berkeley MIDS 210 Capstone. Group: Bronte Baer, Kurt Eulau, Briana Hart, Thomas Welsh.

The CleanCAst project comprises two Github repositories:

1. `CleanCAst_backend`: (this repo) which contains references to data sources and code used to produce carbon intensity model.
2. `CleanCAst_frontend`: repo containing website content made using React, Reactstrap and create-react-app.

## Data Sources

We built CleanCAst using a data pipeline that aggregates data from the following sources:

* The U.S. [Energy Information Administration (EIA)](https://www.eia.gov/) supplied actual historical hourly generation data by source (natural gas, solar, nuclear, etc.) for the entire California grid, and total CO2 emissions for each source.
* The [National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)]() Research Data Archive supplied historical hourly weather forecasts for each latitude and longitude at increments of 0.25Â° via the NCEP GFS 0.25 Degree Global Forecast Grids Historical Archive ds084.1, which we matched to centroids of CEC resource regions below.
* [California Energy Commission](https://www.energy.ca.gov/) supplied maps of [Solar Resource Areas and Wind Resource Areas](https://cecgis-caenergy.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/CAEnergy::solar-resource-areas-2022), as well as generating capacity of those regions. The geographic centroids of each solar region were calculated from shapefiles and capacity-weighted weather and solar radiation forecasts were incorporated into the pipeline.

## Code

All code configured to run on Amazon SageMaker Data Science 3.0 instance.
